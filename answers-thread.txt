Q. Why are there missing keys with 2 threads, but not with 1 thread? 
Identify a sequence of events with 2 threads that can lead to a key being missing. 
Submit your sequence with a short explanation in answers-thread.txt

A. 
A sequence could leads to missing key:
Thread 1: Executing *p = e in function insert();
Thread 2: Executing *p = e in function insert();
Both thread above modify the entry (*p) in table[] simultaneously.
This will let key in either Thread 1 or Thread 2 miss.
